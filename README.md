The Message
A simple, short, interactive-fiction game written in C.
By Robert Sikorski

This game is my first entry in onegameamonth.com and. It's an easy task to
complete that will get me some refreshing in C and git, both of which I've
neglected for a year+ at the point of beginning this project (excluding use 
of C++ or Obj-C).
