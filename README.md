A simple, short, interactive-fiction game written in C.

This game is my first entry in [OneGameAMonth](http://www.onegameamonth.com)(1GAM). It's an easy task to 
complete that will get me some refreshing in C and git, both of which I've neglected
for a year+ at the point of beginning this project (excluding use of C++ or Obj-C).

I have saved the outline for the story in the "docs" folder to prevent spoilage on the front
page for people coming here to pick up the game and play it; at least right now, I'm only
planning to release this through github.

Software implementation goals:
* Simple parser and components for it, which may include:
  * Tokenizing input
  * Grammar identification (require word orders or be flexible?)
* Inventory system (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
* Not to require a map for the player (indicative of scope creep for such a simple project)
